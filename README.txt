This project code is run in a jupyter notebook using python 3.6 (min), pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. 

To install the required packages for this file use the pip_requiements.txt file.

The ipython notebook accesses my csvs through a subdirectory called "./data/", so if through the submission that isnt carried over, 
please make the directory and put the csv files in it.

Make sure the data folder is in the same directory as the .ipynb file.
I have removed all the code that generates the graphs for the sake of keeping the submission as small as possible.
